## Introduction

Welcome to the OptiBrief Guidelines repository! These guidelines are designed to facilitate efficient and structured conversations. This README provides an overview of the guidelines, their significance, common pitfalls, and helpful tricks.

## Guidelines

### 1. Concise Responses

- Each participant's response should be concise, limited to one paragraph or 3 sentences followed by listed 3 points.

### 2. Optimistic Perspective

- Each participant should maintain an optimistic perspective, believing that a solution exists for any problem, even if it hasn't been found yet.

### 3. Code, Quote, and Point Exception

- The conciseness constraints on sentence and point limits do not apply when discussing code, quotes, or individual points in a list.

## Importance

The OptiBrief guidelines are crucial for the following reasons:

1. **Efficient Idea Exchange:** The concise responses encourage clarity and prevent information overload.

2. **Optimism and Solution-Driven:** Maintaining an optimistic perspective fosters a positive problem-solving environment.

3. **Code, Quote, and Point Exception:** Allowing flexibility in code discussions ensures that technical details can be explored comprehensively.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Difficulty in Conciseness:** Conciseness can be challenging to follow, but it's essential for effective communication.

## Helpful Tricks

1. **Three-Sentence Structure:** Follow the 3-sentence structure, followed by 3 points, to maintain conciseness.

2. **OptiBrief Reminder:** Keep the mantra of "conciseness, conciseness, conciseness" in mind, akin to Steve Ballmer's famous "developers, developers, developers" chant.
