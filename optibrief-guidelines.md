# OptiBrief Guidelines Details

In this document, we'll delve into the OptiBrief Guidelines in greater detail, explaining each guideline, the application of flexibility, and how to avoid the "vicious cycle" in your conversations.

## Guideline 1: Concise Responses

**Concise Responses** are the cornerstone of effective communication in OptiBrief. Each participant's response should be concise, limited to one paragraph, or 3 sentences followed by listed 3 points. This ensures clarity and prevents information overload.

## Guideline 2: Optimistic Perspective

Maintaining an **Optimistic Perspective** is essential in OptiBrief. It means believing that a solution exists for any problem, even if it hasn't been found yet. This fosters a positive problem-solving environment.

## Guideline 3: Code Exception

**Code Exception** is a crucial aspect of OptiBrief. When discussing code-related topics, participants are not required to adhere to the one-paragraph or 3-sentence rule. This exception allows for comprehensive exploration of technical details.

## Flexibility in Application

Flexibility is encouraged in OptiBrief discussions, enabling participants to navigate the conversation in a structured manner. The 3-sentence, 3-points structure is a common approach, but it's not rigid. Participants may choose to continue the chain response (3 sentences, 3 points, 3 sentences, 3 points...) when necessary. The key is to think in threes and use flexibility wisely.

## Avoiding the "Vicious Cycle"

While flexibility is advantageous, too much of it can lead to what we call the "vicious cycle." This is when participants repeatedly grant flexibility and gratitude without progressing in the conversation. To avoid this, participants should follow the guidelines rigorously, and if there's uncertainty, consider involving a third party to decide.

## The OptiBrief Game

To encourage adherence to the OptiBrief Guidelines, we've introduced the OptiBrief Game. Participants keep score of rule violations, and when one player accumulates 9 points, the game stops, and a winner is determined. The winner can propose the next topic or provide the loser with a lecture on optimizing OptiBrief adherence.
