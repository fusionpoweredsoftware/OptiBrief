# Pitfalls to Avoid in OptiBrief

In this document, we'll explore common pitfalls that participants should avoid when engaging in OptiBrief conversations. Adhering to the guidelines is essential, but it's also important to be aware of potential pitfalls.

## Pitfall 1: Being Overly Appreciative

While **appreciation** is encouraged in OptiBrief to acknowledge adherence to the guidelines, being overly appreciative can disrupt the flow of the conversation. Participants should use gratitude judiciously, focusing on essential acknowledgments rather than excessive expressions of thanks.

## Pitfall 2: Redundant Acknowledgments

In OptiBrief, **acknowledgment** is essential, but it should be used when necessary. Participants should avoid acknowledging when acknowledgment is implicit or when adherence to the guidelines is clear. Redundant acknowledgments can lead to unnecessary verbosity.

## Pitfall 3: Excessive Sentences

Using too many sentences in OptiBrief can hinder the effectiveness of the conversation. To maintain conciseness, participants should provide only two sentences in response, reserving the third sentence for clarification when required by a question. Avoiding excessive sentences ensures that the conversation remains focused and efficient.

By steering clear of these common pitfalls, participants can engage in OptiBrief discussions effectively, adhering to the guidelines and fostering productive and concise exchanges of ideas.
